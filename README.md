# GeneEvolve
A fast and memory efficient forward-time simulator of whole-genome data

GeneEvolve is a user-friendly and efficient population genetics simulator that handles complex evolutionary scenarios and generates individual-level phenotypes and realistic whole-genome sequence or SNP data.
GeneEvolve runs forward-in-time, which allows it to provide a wide range of scenarios for mating systems, selection, population size and structure, migration, recombination, and environmental effects.
